# System Design Overview

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed system design focusing on the following layers:
1. **Database Layer**: Handles structured data storage with scalable clusters.
2. **Caching Layer**: Speeds up data retrieval using in-memory caching.
3. **Monitoring & Logging Layer**: Tracks system performance and logs crucial events.
4. **CDN Layer**: Ensures efficient content delivery across regions.

The design was created using PlantUML with an AWS Orange theme for better visualization.

## Tools and Services Used
- **AWS RDS**: Scalable relational database service for data storage.
- **AWS ElastiCache**: High-performance in-memory caching layer.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging for system insights.
- **AWS CloudFront**: CDN for optimized content delivery.
- **PlantUML**: For visualizing system architecture.
