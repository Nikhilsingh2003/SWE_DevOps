# System Design Overview

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed system design focusing on the following layers:
1. **Database Layer**: Handles structured data storage with scalable clusters.
2. **Caching Layer**: Speeds up data retrieval using in-memory caching.
3. **Monitoring & Logging Layer**: Tracks system performance and logs crucial events.
4. **CDN Layer**: Ensures efficient content delivery across regions.

The design was created using PlantUML with an AWS Orange theme for better visualization.

## Tools and Services Used
- **AWS RDS**: Scalable relational database service for data storage.
- **AWS ElastiCache**: High-performance in-memory caching layer.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging for system insights.
- **AWS CloudFront**: CDN for optimized content delivery.
- **PlantUML**: For visualizing system architecture.

## Steps to Replicate the Architecture

1. **Clone this repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nikhilsingh2003/SWE_DevOps.git
   2. **Install PlantUML** or use an online editor like [PlantUML Editor](https://plantuml-editor.kkeisuke.dev/).

3. **Use the provided PlantUML code to generate the diagram**:  
   - Open your PlantUML tool or editor.  
   - Copy and paste the code from `design.puml` into the editor.  
   - Render the diagram.
